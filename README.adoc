= WTF IOS Prepend Padding for Trailing Space in Text ?! - Compatibility TextView for Android

== The Story behind

When there is trailing space in text, and the text is centered, IOS will ignore
it.  Fine.  But if it also _wrap_content_ (in Android wording), it *will add
padding to the front*, in order to center the text.
